# Matt-Daan
University Project created for my Open Source Programming course in PHP
The project is based on the idea of tracking and reporting various electoral malpractices done by political parties during elections without compromising the security of the reporter.
For validation purposes, PHP Mailer is used for otp generation and verification.
